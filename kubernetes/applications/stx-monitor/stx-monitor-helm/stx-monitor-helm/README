This directory contains all StarlingX charts that need to be built for this
application. Some charts are common across applications. These common charts
reside in the stx-config/kubernetes/helm-charts directory. To include these in
this application update the build_srpm.data file and use the COPY_LIST_TO_TAR
mechanism to populate these common charts.

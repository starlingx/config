This directory contains all StarlingX charts that need to be built to support
platform integration immediately after installation. Some charts are common
across applications. These common charts reside in the
stx-config/kubernetes/helm-charts directory. To include these in this
application update the build_srpm.data file and use the COPY_LIST_TO_TAR
mechanism to populate these commom charts.

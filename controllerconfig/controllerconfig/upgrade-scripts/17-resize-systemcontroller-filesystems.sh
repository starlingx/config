# This script is used to resize the platform (and backup, consequently) filesystems
# on System Controller DC, so that to allow an increased parallelism on subclouds
# deployment (100+ deployments in parallel). This script will:
# - Check if deployment is System Controller DC from distributed_cloud_role variable
#   sourced from /etc/platform/platform.conf
# - Check if platform filesystem needs to be resized (i.e. if less than 20GB in size)
#   and skip the execution if not
# - Check if there is enough space on cgts-vg to resize on both controllers
# - Resize backup filesystem on each controller and check if resized successfully
# - Resize platform controllerfs and check if resized successfully
# - NOTE: this script has to be idempotent and reentrant, since upgrade-activate can
#   be called multiple times during the upgrade
# - NOTE: this script must not fail the upgrade if there is not enough disk space to
#   resize, and only have to warn the user about the limitation
